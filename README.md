# Trajectory Prediction using Equivariant Continuous Convolution (ECCO)

This is the codes for ICLR 2021 paper [Trajectory Prediction using Equivariant Continuous Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11344), by Robin Walters, Jinxi Li and Rose Yu.

## Installation
This codebase is trained on Python 3.6.6+, PyTorch 1.5.0, tensorpack 0.10.1 and Cuda 10. For the usage of argoverse dataset, [argoverse-api](https://github.com/argoai/argoverse-api) is required. We recommand the reader to follow their guide to install the complete api and datasets.
